==================================
Welcome to The Libertree Installer
==================================

The installer will attempt to fulfill the following tasks:

  1. Create a system user for libertree
  2. Install libertree as that system user.
     This includes:
       - install the latest version of bundler as a local gem
       - setup a PostgreSQL owner and databases
       - install the Libertree Ruby backend
       - install the Libertree Ramaze frontend

To install system packages you will need root privileges.  If sudo is installed
you may need to input your password to execute certain tasks as root.  For
database administration you may need the password of the PostgreSQL superuser
on some systems.

You should have installed all dependencies before running this script.
